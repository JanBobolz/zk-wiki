**🪑 Session chair:** ??
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>
**✍️ Notetaker:** Jan 
<small>(Duties: Take Obsidian notes during the session 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
This session serves as a bird's-eye overview of recent (ZK)SNARKs and real-world applications. We will particularly focus on the following contents from Lecture 2. 

1. SNARK overview
    - Parse "Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge"
    - Blockchain applications
    - Example: SNARK for correctly processed photos

2. Paradigm of building SNARKs
    - IOP + FCOM = SNARK
    - Schwartz-Zippel lemma
    - Example: Poly-IOP for equality test
    - Example: Poly-IOP for set inclusion test

## ❓ Quiz Questions
You are encouraged to think about the following questions before the session starts. 

1. In which blockchain applications, SNARK without ZK is sufficient? 
2. What are the statement and witness in the photo-processing example?
    - What kind of attack would be possible if the signature is missing?
3. Why is preprocessing useful? 
4. In the equality test protocol, what happens if the prover doesn't respect the degree bound?
5. In the set inclusion test protocol, what happens if the oracle $q$ sent by the prover is not a polynomial?
