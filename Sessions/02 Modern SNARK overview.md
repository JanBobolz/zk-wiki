Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>
**✍️ Notetaker:** Jan 
<small>(Duties: Take Obsidian notes during the session 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>
