**🪑 Session chair:** ?
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** ?
<small>(Duties: Take notes during the session, push them to the wiki afterwards 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
This session covers code-based polynomial commitments. We will particularly focus on the following contents from Lecture 6 (see [[#📚 Material]]). 

1. Error Correcting Code
    - Definition
    - Reed-Solomon code

2. Linear code based polynomial commitment
    - Vec-Mat product commitment with $\sqrt{d}$ size proof
    - Vec-Mat product + linear code + Merkle tree
    - Proximity test and consistency check

## ❓ Quiz Questions
