**🪑 Session chair:** Jan
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** Liz
<small>(Duties: Take notes during the session, push them to the wiki afterwards 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
- Encoding circuits as a [[QAP]]
- [[Pinocchio]] / [[Groth16]] style SNARKs

## 📚 Material
- [Lecture](https://youtu.be/I7TXIHXamwM) ([Slides](https://zk-learning.org/assets/lecture9.pdf))
- Akira's notes at [[Pinocchio]] and [[Groth16]]

## 📝 Notes
### Subsession 1 (Oct 31)

### Subsession 2 (Nov 7)
Open questions: 
1. Why is it called "rank 1" constraint system?
2. What's a good example where [[Rank 1 Constraint System|R1CS]] is a much more efficient representation of the desired relation relation than an [[Algebraic Circuit]]?
