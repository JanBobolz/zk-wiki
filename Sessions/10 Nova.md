**🪑 Session chair:** Jan
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** Jan 
<small>(Duties: Take notes during the session, push them to the wiki afterwards 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
Our goal is to understand (the main ideas of) the [[Nova]] proof system. 
Secondarily, let's quickly go over Section 1 in this [blog post](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/tk8LoE-rC2w0MJ4wCWwaJwbq8-Ih8DXnLUf7aJX1FbU).
Be able to answer the following questions:
- What is a [[Folding Scheme]], formally?
	- How is it different from a proof system?
	- How do we understand its properties?
- How do you get from [[Folding Scheme]] to [[Incrementally Verifiable Computation|IVC]]?
	- What's that "I've folded correctly" proof business and how complicated is that to prove?
- What's the performance benefit over recursive [[SNARG|SNARK]]s?
- (Is there magic happening with [[Relaxed R1CS]] or is that just a boring technical thing?)

## 📚 Material
- [An incomplete guide to Folding](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/tk8LoE-rC2w0MJ4wCWwaJwbq8-Ih8DXnLUf7aJX1FbU)
	- Section 1 (general IVC overview) for context.
	- Section 2 (Nova)
- [Nova paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370)
- [Whiteboard session (video)](https://youtu.be/SwonTtOQzAk)
- (+ ... whatever resource you find most appropriate)
