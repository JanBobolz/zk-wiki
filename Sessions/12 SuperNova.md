**🪑 Session chair:** Jan
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** Jan 
<small>(Duties: Take notes during the session, push them to the wiki afterwards 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
Our goal is to understand (the main ideas of) [[SuperNova]], the (non-uniform) [[Incrementally Verifiable Computation|IVC]] scheme. 
Questions we want to be able to answer:
- How does [[SuperNova]] work? How does it generalize [[Nova]]?

## 📚 Material
- We're still following, roughly, [An incomplete guide to Folding](https://taiko.mirror.xyz/tk8LoE-rC2w0MJ4wCWwaJwbq8-Ih8DXnLUf7aJX1FbU), SuperNova is Section 4
- [SuperNova paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1758)
- [zkStudyClub Presentation](https://youtu.be/ilrvqajkrYY) ([Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AlexPruden/zk-study-club-supernova-srinath-setty-ms-research))
- (+ ... whatever resource you find most appropriate)
