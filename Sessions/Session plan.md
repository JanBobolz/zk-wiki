# Sessions
## 1: History and Basics
June 01, 15, and 22

[[01 History and Basics]]

## 2: Modern SNARK overview
First steps towards understanding modern SNARKs (current goal: [[PLONK]])

June 29 and July 6

[[02 Modern SNARK overview]]

## 3: Simple PLONK
We will understand the basic PolyIOP gadgets while looking at PLONK as an example. The session also includes a quick overview of the KZG polynomial commitment. 

July 13, 20, and 27

[[10 Nova]]


# Planned but not sessioned
- Some understanding of folding schemes (relaxed R1CS and such)
- Lookup arguments (e.g., [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGjbczKGm4s&list=PL8Vt-7cSFnw1gx51WHRgAtioVqAjzMS1w&index=12))
- Rest of https://zk-learning.org
- [[Lattice ZK]] from https://lattices-meet-hashes23.epfl.ch/program.html
