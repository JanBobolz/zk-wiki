**🪑 Session chair:** Jan
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** Akira
<small>(Duties: Take notes during the session, push them to the wiki afterwards 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>

## 🎯 Goals
This session covers the KZG commitment and PLONKish PolyIOP. We will particularly focus on the following contents from Lecture 5 (see [[#📚 Material]]). 

1. The KZG polynomial commitment scheme
    - Efficiency: commitment size, proof size, proving time, verification time
    - Compiling the equality check IOP with KZG
    - Security will be covered in the next session

2. Simple-PLONK PolyIOP
    - Gadgets for univariate polynomials: ZeroTest, SumCheck, ProdCheck, (Prescribed) Permutation Check
    - PLONK's arithmetization
