## 🐣 Old-school proof systems
- [[Cut-and-Choose]] (the very beginnings of ZK proofs, but encompasses some modern constructions, too)
- [[Schnorr Proofs]] (the king of efficiency for statements about [[DLOG]]s)
- [[Groth-Sahai Proofs]] (the first(?) useful non-interactive proof system in the [[CRS]] model without [[Random Oracle]]s)

## 🔮 [[Interactive oracle proof|IOP]] family
- [[BCS16]] (Original [[Interactive oracle proof|IOP]] SNARK construction)
- [[Aurora]] (improved [[Rank One Constraint System|R1CS]] → [[Interactive oracle proof|IOP]] compiler)
- [[Supersonic]] (RSA/[[Class Group]] [[Polynomial Commitment]]s)
- [[PLONK]]

## 🧙‍♂️ [[Linear probabilistically checkable proofs|Linear PCP]] family


## 🪭 [[Bulletproof]]-style
(split and fold)
- [[Bulletproofs]]

## 🤯 MPC in the Head
- [[ZKBoo]] line of work
- [[Ligero]]
- The cheese line of work (designated verifier, using information-theoretically secure MACs and Vector OLE)
	- [[Mac'n'Cheese]]
	- Feta
	- ...
