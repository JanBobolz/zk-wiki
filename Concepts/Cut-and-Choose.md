QR/Graph-Iso: Basic "send random valid instance, then *either* reveal witness for random instance *or* randomized witness for randomized input instance" protocols.
3-colorable: send commitments, open some of them. 

> [!question] What's the right definition for Cut-and-Choose? Do 3-colorable, QR, and Graph Isomorphism belong in this category?
> https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(88)90005-0 coins the "cut-and-choose" name and indicates 3-colorable would fall into this category, I think.
