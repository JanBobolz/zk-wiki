**🪑 Session chair:** ??
<small>(Duties: Read material above-average carefully 🤓; prepare fallback discussions/questions (worst-case: just prepare some quiz questions about the material) 🙋. Prepare a few slides to guide the session through subtopics (this is <i>not</i> supposed to be a <i>detailed</i> summary of the material)</small>

**✍️ Notetaker:** Jan 
<small>(Duties: Take Obsidian notes during the session 📝. Moderate to get input for the wiki pages 🧠. Make people summarize / dumb down discussion results to keep things comprehensible for everyone 🧑‍⚖️.)</small>
